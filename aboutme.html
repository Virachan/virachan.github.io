											Born and brought up in one of the busiest metropolitan cities of the world – Mumbai – I have always been surrounded by an interesting mix of people, plenty of activities, and a multicultural community.  As a child, I loved going to my school – <a href="https://pvgsvidyabhawan.org/">Pune Vidyarthi Griha’s Vidya Bhawan</a> (India) – where I spent some of the best time of my life and completed a formative journey of 12 years.  This was the time when my fascination for Astronomy took birth.  I read several Astronomy and space science books, some of which I received as prizes from my participation in extra-curricular activities.  In the first year of my Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in <a href="https://www.ruiacollege.edu/">Ramnarain Ruia College</a> (India), I took up Computer Science as one of my subjects that introduced me to command-line interface and programming in C.  Surprising or not, it shaped my life!

											Moving to Canada with my family in 2011 was a mighty leap, not because it was a 20-hour long flight trip, but because it landed me on the track that I was destined to be on – the “astronomical” track!  The four years of my Honours BSc degree in Astronomical Sciences at the <a href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto Mississauga</a> offered me the skill set that I needed to pursue my Master of Science (MSc) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees, both in Astronomy at <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/index.html">The University of Western Ontario (Western)</a>.  During the seven years of my graduate school and a year of postdoctoral research, I travelled great distances to 18 cities in 5 countries across 4 continents on the globe – a genuine adventure that perfectly blended recreation with my work!!  Under the impeccable guidance of my mentors and supervisors, and through my professional training at world-class facilities and institutions, I moulded myself into a researcher, educator, and communicator.

											Outside my work sphere, I am an art-loving person, always enthusiastic about creating something new!  My free time is ‘me’ time.  Dancing, singing, and free-hand designing are outlets of self-expression for me.  At other times, I am a self-motivated writer.  Through my graduate school travel, I discovered how much I love visiting places and making new connections with people.  As an Astronomer, I believe reaching out to people and sharing stories makes it possible to connect the dots and bring the universe down to Earth!
